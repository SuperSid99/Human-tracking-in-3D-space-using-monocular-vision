\chapter*{Abstract}
This thesis through its scope presents a method to use monocular vision input streams (i.e. images and videos) and calculate the three-dimensional coordinates of people/objects present in the stream. The method utilizes vanishing points and perspective views to calculate the relative depth of the target subject or object in consideration. With the help of an absolute origin and a step size, the method transforms the relative depth into absolute coordinates. We lay out and extensively discuss the math behind the method and then finally showcase the results of the method over different perspective views.
